# Hellow-my-friends

Hellow fancy world !

Just my firt repository on this site, to learn more !

My name ? Don't need to know ! Call me Niamo ! Just a student in some "training" for becomming web developer ! Oh, and so sorry for my bad English. That's the fact : I'm super duper french, like, born in France and... nerver be outside of this little world. What a sad story, isn't it ? Ooh, and I'm only 22 years old. Don't know if i'm young or not... But I do feel a little young in my class. Mmmh. Strange !

My dream ? Work with passion, with PC and all of it. I love everything in it. Absolutely beautiful ! And, also... TRAVEL ALL AROUND THE GLOBE YAY ! Indeed.

(Don't forget, I'm a unicorn and I love to fly like "nothing wrong will happen guys ! Keep smiling !")
